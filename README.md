## Requirements

Write an application that tracks jogging times of users

* User must be able to create an account and log in [:done]
* When logged in, user can see his times he entered [:todo test view/controller]
* Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time [:todo test view/controller,:todo fix validation display for time_in_minutes, date]
* When displayed, each time entry has an average speed [:todo test view/controller]
* Filter by dates from-to[:todo finish]
* Report on average speed & distance per week[:todo test view/controller,add ui for going back to index view]
* REST API – for all user actions 
* In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
* All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. 
* Bonus: unit tests!
* You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.

NOTE: Please keep in mind that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills.
We expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesn’t have any obvious missing pieces.
